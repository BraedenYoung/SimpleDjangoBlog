  So, for Halloween my girlfriend and I were planning
  on dressing up as Doctor Who, and the TARDIS. Unfortunately,
  when we received the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/1c76/">light-up headband</a>
  the light didn't fade in and out.

To fix this I made a pretty well documented circuit using a 555 timer, a capacitor,
and a transistor. Due to a bit lack of time and parts, I needed to slap three
resistors in serial to get the required resistance needed to control the fading of the light.

      The final circuit ended up coming out but really pushing the space
      restrictions of the headband. This resulted in having to remove the
      internal battery for an external battery that I figured could easily
      be tucked in the back of a dress.

      It also required using a rotary hand tool to clear out as much as
      I could from the housing.

      Even still fitting it in ended up being a bit of a challenge....

      Using a bit of glue to put it all back

      together and to help with the wire management, finally finished.

<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Overall a simple enough build with </span>some challenges due to time <span style="line-height: 1.6471;">and space restrictions.</span>
